# Next steps

1. Extend each SortAlgo from AbstractSortAlgorith
2. Add knowledge to GraphPanel, which SortAlgorithm it uses
3. Add interesting drawingVariables (like currentSortIndex for bubblesort) as members of the SortingAlgorithm, within the paintMethod from the GraphPanel draw each SortAlgorithm individually 
   (e.g have different drawFunctions within GraphPanel). Also interesting : Already sorted index/array sizes etc.
